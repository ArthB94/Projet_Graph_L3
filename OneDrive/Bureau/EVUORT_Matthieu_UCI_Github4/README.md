# Module 4 Assignment
Hi, here is my project for the last assignment **4**.

## How does it works ?
- Clone this repository.
- Then, run **npm run migrate**
- Next, run **npm run seed**
- Afterwards, run **npm run start**
- Finally, open your website and search **localhost:3000**

## Things to konw
- Don't forget to refresh the database pushing the "Show me the Animes" button when you make changes to it (insert, update, delete)
- Use the id to delete/change an anime.
